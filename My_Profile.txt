<h2> style="font-size:18px;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p> I am most interested in the programming aspect of IT. 
Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to make my own game and I wanted to be the game designer until a few years ago when I realised I wasn’t that good at drawing or designing. 
I turned towards the other aspect which is the programming side and ever since then I have been so intrigued, and I have wanted to learn more about it. 
I don’t have very much IT experience outside of what I learnt in high school, which is very little and that is why I am doing this course. </p>

<p>I chose to study at RMIT because of its highly regarded reputation of being a great technology-based university as well as the different opportunities that the course presents and the amount of learning I can have. 
It also has a great location that I can get to easily.</p>

<p>I expect to learn the basics of information technology in this course, including programming, security and protection, hardware and software, databases and database management, website building, user experience and design and much more about the overall world of IT.</p>
